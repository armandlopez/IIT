					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Armand Lopez, I am 19 years old, and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in the Philippines which I lived there until I was 6 years old, and then my family and I moved to Australia. I lived in Western Australia for 3 years before spending most my life in Victoria. I speak both Tagalog (Filipino) and English, but I tend to prefer speaking English because I am more accustomed to it. I am with a family of four, with my sister being the youngest and myself being the oldest.</p>
					<p> During high school, I took many IT classes as I found it interesting, and I would continue that interest by enrolling into an IT course at RMIT to acquire as much knowledge and learn skills related to IT. In my spare time, I love watching movies and playing video games with friends. Video games has been a passion for us since primary school and it would continue to keep us all close even to this day. It is one of the main reasons why I want to pursue a career in IT. </p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Growing up as a child, revolutionary technology was being introduced and so I became exposed to the new technology which would spark my interest in all thing’s technology related. I also grew up with a passion for video games as my friends introduced me to it to keep spending time and enjoying the fun with each other while we were at home is a passion we continue to enjoy even up to the present day. The influence of technology in my childhood days would lead me to pick IT classes through high school, where I mainly learned programming in python and creating databases. Although that is the only IT experience I have ever had, I would eventually be enrolled into RMIT studying a Bachelor of Information and Technology to continue to learn new skills and gain experience that is necessary after graduation..</p>

					<h2>Software Developer</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>A software developer is someone who receives a consumer’s requests in a software and the software developer’s job is to brainstorm, design and create the software that the customer requested. Software developers work with software engineers to write the code for the program and to design its interface although software developers mainly focus on the software’s coding. </p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Currently, I only have basic skills in programming which I learned during my time in high school with the two coding languages being python and visual basic. I also gained a little experience in creating a simple database during high school. .</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>The qualifications of a junior software developer are to be a university graduate. Although the job listing doesn’t specify a required major, it is safe to infer that a degree related to IT would be recommended. The required skills are to have experience in a range of different coding languages, api design/development, web language such as html, cyber security and creating databases. There is more of an emphasis on having experience in api design and coding languages rather than the other skills due to the nature of the job focusing on coding and api design. Someone who is familiar on one specific skill rather being familiar with multiple is less likely to be employed due to the nature of the job..</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>Right now, I have enrolled into the RMIT Bachelor of Information and Technology course to further expand my knowledge in programming and using databases and to also learn other sets of skills that could help for employment in the future. Being experienced .</p>
