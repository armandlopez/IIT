					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Armand Lopez, I am 19 years old, and I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in the Philippines which I lived there until I was 6 years old, and then my family and I moved to Australia. I lived in Western Australia for 3 years before spending most my life in Victoria. I speak both Tagalog (Filipino) and English, but I tend to prefer speaking English because I am more accustomed to it. I am with a family of four, with my sister being the youngest and myself being the oldest.</p>
					<p> During high school, I took many IT classes as I found it interesting, and I would continue that interest by enrolling into an IT course at RMIT to acquire as much knowledge and learn skills related to IT. In my spare time, I love watching movies and playing video games with friends. Video games has been a passion for us since primary school and it would continue to keep us all close even to this day. It is one of the main reasons why I want to pursue a career in IT. </p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Growing up as a child, revolutionary technology was being introduced and so I became exposed to the new technology which would spark my interest in all thing’s technology related. I also grew up with a passion for video games as my friends introduced me to it to keep spending time and enjoying the fun with each other while we were at home is a passion we continue to enjoy even up to the present day. The influence of technology in my childhood days would lead me to pick IT classes through high school, where I mainly learned programming in python and creating databases. Although that is the only IT experience I have ever had, I would eventually be enrolled into RMIT studying a Bachelor of Information and Technology to continue to learn new skills and gain experience that is necessary after graduation.</p>

					<h2>Software Developer</h2>
					<li><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56328885?type=standard#sol=0c4a4d6c263edc383f78c2d0553635c053c372d5" target="_blank">Job Description</a></li>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>A software developer is someone who receives a consumer’s requests in a software and the software developer’s job is to brainstorm, design and create the software that the customer requested. Software developers work with software engineers to write the code for the program and to design its interface although software developers mainly focus on the software’s coding. This position was appealing to me because I’ve loved programming ever since I was introduced to it in high school and that aspect of programming as a software developer is why I want to pursue IT during university and post-university as well. </p>
					<h3>Qualifications</h3>
					<p>The qualifications of a junior software developer are to be a university graduate. Although the job listing doesn’t specify a required major, it is safe to infer that a degree related to IT would be recommended. The required skills are to have experience in a range of different coding languages, api design/development, web language such as html, cyber security and creating databases. There is more of an emphasis on having experience in api design and coding languages rather than the other skills due to the nature of the job focusing on coding and api design. Someone who is familiar on one specific skill rather being familiar with multiple is less likely to be employed due to the nature of the job.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Have</h3>
					<p>Currently, I only have basic skills in programming which I learned during my time in high school with the two coding languages being python and visual basic. I also gained a little experience in creating a simple database during high school. </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>Right now, I have enrolled into the RMIT Bachelor of Information and Technology course to further expand my knowledge in programming and using databases and to also learn other sets of skills that could help for employment in the future. Being experienced </p>

					<h2>What do these results mean?</h3>
					<p>The MBTI test shows that I belong to the ‘Adventurer’ group (ISFP-A) and are classified as having a ‘confident individualism’. It is found that my personality loves to maintain harmony in a group, making sure that people feel comfortable to act freely. Receiving criticism can make me feel uncomfortable and could sometimes cause arguments to occur but it is found that afterwards I am able to move on and not dwell on it to much. The learning preference test shows that I prefer visual learning over other types of learning. Almost half of my learning (44%) is visual based, which is then followed by auditory learning and finally kinesthetic learning (hand-on). The five big personality test shows that my main personality is agreeableness which indicates that I am someone that is kind, considerate and always gets along with others.</p>
					<h2>How would this influence your team?</h3>
					<p>Looking at the results, it shows that I can get along with everyone in a team as my MBTI tests shows that I like to make people comfortable with each other so that our teamwork as team improves and stays strong. The 5-personality test also backs this up as I am always making sure that I treat everyone equally and with kindness. Although a problem that can be considered is from my learning preference test because if am in a group where most people are not visual learners, I could slow the work/discussion pace in the group. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>“We Can Communicate” is an app that will be created that is available to download on IOS/Android in which its main function is allow for communication between non-deaf people and people who are deaf and vice versa. This app will allow people with no knowledge in sign language to easily to communicate with those who have impaired hearing allowing us to “build bridges, not walls” (Suzy Kassem) between both parties. The app will primarily be focused in Australia using Australian Sign Language (AUSLAN) but could be upgraded to include other sign languages and also other spoken languages other than English. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Communication between people is very important and there are many apps that is used to translate one language to another but there is a very limited number of apps that are reliable enough to convert sign language to spoken language and vice versa. This project will be popular on the market due to its limited competition and also acts to help improve the society. Currently in Australia, the amount deaf people using Australian Sign Language (AUSLAN) is 82%. With the overwhelming majority of deaf people using sign language, communicating with those who don’t know sign language is a big problem.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The product will be an app that will be available for download on both IOS and Android devices. The app’s interface will consist of the top 75% of the screen displaying what is being captured on the camera and the other 25% of the bottom of the screen will consists of buttons that bring up menus and settings. For three of the clickable buttons, one will be used to switch which camera is being used, the other will be used to determine if speech is being converted to sign language or sign language to speech, and the last button will be the record button which will used to record the speech or sign language and turn into its respective translation. For speech to sign language, after a phrase has been recorded, it is followed by a fully body animation performing the translated speech into sign language. When translating sign language to speech, the user will record themselves doing sign language and afterwards the app will show a text translation of the action. The app will be available in Australia as the primary sign language that will be used is AUSLAN (Australia Sign Language). AUSLAN is conveyed using hand, arm, and body movements hence why the animation will include a fully body to display those movements. Due to AUSLAN using two hands for the language rather than ASL (American Sign Language) which uses one hand, the app was designed with the option to use the outward camera to allow the other person to record the person performing the sign language. AUSLAN has a total of 68 hand movements and in order for the app to assign what word is associated with the action, a database will be created with the predefined meanings for each action. The app will receive the speech or action input, in which a built-in program in the app will assign it to its matching translation in the database. The program will then take the translation and output it into either an animation or text form based on the input. Due to the apps availability being only in Australia, it prevents the users from using other sign languages and spoken languages other than English, creating a minor barrier for those who can’t speak English and or people who use ASL to communicate. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>To create the app, the equipment that will be primarily used is a laptop/desktop computer in order to design the code create the database for the app. Motion cameras will also be needed to record the predefined actions that will be present in the app. To allow the app to perform these functions voice recognition software needs to be used. An open-source voice recognition software such a KALDI will be used identify speech and a licenced motion recognition software motion will be used to record the movements and will be implemented in a database. A database software that is able to store movement as information will be required in order for it to assign it with its translation for speech.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>In order to create the app, the skills needed is a team who are very experienced in the required fields. An individual must be knowledgeable in programming, with experience in a wide variety of coding languages and complexities as a software such as KALDI uses c++. As such, installation of necessary programs will be based on what coding language will be primarily used. There also needs to be a person who is knowledgeable in motion recognition, knowing what type of motion cameras are required and where they need to be installed to reduce the amount of error that is captured.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful, people who are hearing impaired do not have to worry about being unable to communicate with those who can hear and vice versa because the app will remove that communication barrier. Although not everyone will have the app, should a situation occur where the app is needed, the app can be quickly downloaded from the app store and communication can be established. Eventually the funds generated from the app can be used to improve the app and branch out to other countries. This app is another way to help those who have disabilities to live out their daily lives with more ease.</p>
